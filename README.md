# Bash Installer Framework

... is a simple bash-based installation framework for your daily tedious installation tasks.

## Getting started

Not much to do here, simply copy over `install.sh`, `config.sh` and the `utils` directory to your project, modify the `config.sh` and start creating tasks.

## Tasks

Installer tasks should reside in the `tasks` subdirectory and should be prefixed with a two-digit number (e.g., `00_check_system.sh`), since they are read in and executed in alphanumeric order. Tasks have three states, `NOT RUN`, `FAILED`, and `DONE`. The state is saved persistently across installer runs.

Each task needs to define two functions, `<taskname>_init` and `<taskname>_run`, where `<taskname>` is everything between the two-digit prefix and the `.sh` file extension (e.g., `check_system`). The `init` needs to register the task with the installer framework by calling the `task_setup` function:

```bash
task_setup <taskname> <shortname> <description> [dependencies]
```

The `run` method should do the hard work and should return `${E_SUCCESS}` on success, `${E_FAILURE}` otherwise. If the task needs to save additional data persistently, it can do so by storing it in its own dictionary by calling `dictSet <taskname> <key> <value>`. For convenience, tasks may define getter functions for their data (see `tasks/03_ganja_smoking.sh` and `tasks/04_his_highness.sh` for example).

Here's a simple example of a task:

```bash
# File: 01_install_packages.sh

function install_packages_init() {
  task_setup "install_packages" "Install packages" "Install system packages" "check_system"
}

function install_packages_run() {
  log_info "Installing packages..."
  
  log_command apt-get install gcc
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    log_error "Failed to install packages."
    return ${E_FAILURE}
  fi

  return ${E_SUCCESS}
}
```

## Utilities

The installer framework provides simple logging, UI, templating, and command line option utilities:

### Logging

The logging utility lets the user log information to a logfile named `install.sh.<date>.log`. Logging knows six different *severities*, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `IMPORTANT`, `ERROR`, `START`, `FINISH`. The latter two are only used to denote when a task has been started and when it has finished, and they are only used by the framework itself (see `run_task` function in `utils/05_tasks.sh`). The other four may be used as desired by calling their corresponding `log_<severity>` functions. Each function takes at least a message as its first argument, and may be additionally passed arbitrary data which is printed as `DEBUG` information in the logfile.

By default, most of the logging output is printed to `STDOUT` as well, this may be adjusted using the `LOG_STDOUT` configuration variable in `config.sh`.

### UI

Three simple UI functions exist to help the user retrieve information from the customer. Examples:

```bash
if ask "Are you sure?"; then
  ...
fi

username=$(enter_variable "Please enter your username.")
if [ -z ${username} ]; then
  # The user didn't enter anything! Error out.
fi

password=$(enter_hidden_variable "Please enter a password.")
...
```

Please note that the `enter_variable` and `enter_hidden_variable` calls now present a default prompt `>> ` to the user, so there is no need to put `: ` after your message. Additionally, `enter_variable` now takes an optional second default value parameter.

```
port=$(enter_variable "Please enter the port." "80")
```

### Templating

As writing a configuraton file is a pretty common task for an installer, I implemented a simple templating engine, borrowing ideas from [here](http://qa.ubuntu.com/2012/09/20/a-basic-templating-engine-in-bash/) and the syntax from [ERuby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby). Call like this:

```
render_template "srcfile" "dstfile" "var1" "val1" "var2" "val2" ...
```

`srcfile` may look like this:

```
This is a templating source file with <%= var1 %> and <%= var 2 %>.
```

See `tasks/05_come_down.sh` for an example.

### Command line options

To add a command line option to the install script, use one of the following functions:

```bash
add_command_line_option <name> <longopt> <shortopt> <description> <default>
add_command_line_switch <name> <longopt> <shortopt> <description>
```

A command line switch has a boolean value and always defaults to `false`. `name`, `longopt`, and `shortopt` may not contain spaces.

To retrieve the command line option's values, use something like either

```bash
local var=$(get_command_line_option <name>)
```

or

```bash
if has_command_line_switch? <name>; then
  ...
```

### Semantic Versioning

You can extract parts from semantic version numbers (i.e., `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`) or compare semantic version numbers using the following functions:

```bash
local major=$(semver_major "1.2.3")

if semver_eq "1.2.3" "1.2.3"; then
  ...
```

### YAML

You can read values from a YAML file using Ruby.

```bash
local val=$(yaml_get "database.yml" "production" "user")
```
